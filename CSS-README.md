# CSS Basics

Below is the CSS file for my HTML document. It adds the *style* to my page.

## What do CSS and HTML have in common?

 They use the same identifiers! 
 Wait, they what? 
    
 Let's break that down. The *tags*, *class names* and *id's* we used in our *html* will be used once again in our *css*. So if I want to give my entire *body*, say, a background of blue, I would use that tag *inside* my CSS and give it a color of blue! Still confused? Let's see what it looks like below!

 ```css
 body{
    background: blue;

}
 ```

 Ta-dah! A blue page! We just created our first *style* for our document! But you know, this blue page is a little... boring. It also doesn't show me my container or my squares! Lets add some color to each of them so we can see them! We are also gonna give them some sizing, so we can tell them apart!

 ```css
 
 ```
